However, not all RB411 devices are the same. Depending on the model, they may have different specifications and capabilities. One of the factors that determines the functionality of the RB411 is the license level. The license level is a number from 0 to 6 that indicates what features are available on the device. For example, level 0 is a free trial license that expires after 24 hours, level 1 is a free license that allows only basic features, level 2 is a license for wireless client and bridge mode only, and so on.
  
The RB411 comes with a default license level of 3, which allows it to be used as a wireless station or a point-to-point link. However, if you want to use it as an access point or a point-to-multipoint link, you will need to upgrade it to level 4. Level 4 is a license that enables wireless AP mode, wireless client mode with multiple connections, Nstreme protocol support, EoIP tunneling support, and more. Level 4 also allows you to use some advanced features of RouterOS, such as hotspot service, web proxy, VPN server, and more.

To upgrade your RB411 to level 4, you will need to purchase a license key from MikroTik or one of their authorized resellers. You can find the list of resellers on their website. The price of the level 4 license key is $45 USD. Once you have the license key, you can enter it in the RouterOS web interface or through the Winbox tool. You can also use the Netinstall program to reinstall RouterOS with the new license key.
  
If you don't want to buy a separate license key, you can also choose an RB411 model that already has level 4 installed from the factory. For example, the RB411A has level 4 by default and also has more memory (64 MB RAM) and NAND storage. The RB411AR has level 4 by default and also has an integrated 2.4 GHz wireless card with MMCX connector. The RB411U has level 4 by default and also has a USB port and a miniPCIe slot for connecting a 3G card.
  
As you can see, upgrading your RB411 to level 4 can unlock many possibilities for your network. You can use it as a wireless access point for your home or office, as a wireless bridge or repeater for extending your coverage, as a wireless router or firewall for securing your network, or as a wireless hotspot or VPN server for providing internet access to your guests or clients. The RB411 is a small but powerful device that can handle various tasks with ease.

## How to Configure Your RB411 Level 4 Device
  
Once you have your RB411 level 4 device ready, you will need to configure it according to your needs and preferences. There are two ways to access the configuration interface of your device: through the web browser or through the Winbox tool. Both methods require that you connect your device to a computer or a network using an Ethernet cable.
  
The web browser method is the simplest and most convenient way to configure your device. You just need to open your web browser and type the IP address of your device in the address bar. The default IP address is 192.168.88.1, but you can change it later if you want. You will be prompted to enter a username and password to log in. The default username is admin and the default password is blank, but you can change them later as well. After logging in, you will see the web interface of RouterOS, which is divided into several sections: Quick Set, WebFig, Terminal, Files, Log, and System.
  
The Quick Set section allows you to perform basic settings for your device, such as changing the IP address, setting up a wireless network, enabling a firewall, and more. The WebFig section allows you to access all the features and functions of RouterOS in a graphical way, similar to the Winbox tool. The Terminal section allows you to access the command-line interface of RouterOS, where you can type commands and scripts for advanced configuration. The Files section allows you to manage the files stored on your device, such as backups, licenses, firmware updates, and more. The Log section allows you to view the system logs and events of your device. The System section allows you to manage the system settings of your device, such as rebooting, resetting, upgrading, and more.
  
The Winbox tool is another way to configure your device. It is a standalone application that you can download from the MikroTik website or from your device itself. To download it from your device, you need to open your web browser and type http://192.168.88.1/winbox/winbox.exe in the address bar. You will be asked to save the file on your computer. After downloading it, you can run it and enter the IP address of your device in the Connect To field. You will also need to enter the username and password as before. After connecting, you will see the Winbox interface, which is similar to the web interface but with more options and features.
  
Both the web interface and the Winbox tool allow you to configure your device in a user-friendly way. However, if you want to learn more about RouterOS and its capabilities, you can also use the manual or the wiki provided by MikroTik. These resources contain detailed information and examples on how to use RouterOS for various purposes and scenarios.
